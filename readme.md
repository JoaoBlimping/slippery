# Slippery (potentially a working title I dunno)
This game was essentially just a way to test out the features I was working on to build the engine for league of piss 2,
but as usual my mind has gotten ahead of itself so there is a bit more to it now.

The general idea is that you are a person struggling with every day life due to problems of the mind. In the game this
struggle will be represented by a very specific action and point in time. You will be essentially faced with some kind
of minigame or possibly bullet hell sequence which you must complete in order to be able to progress with your life
successfully. However, this task is impossible without first collecting some kinds of special tokens inside your mind
which will allow you to function. Because you cannot initially beat the starting sequence you will lose it.

## The structure of the game
When you fail or die in a segment of the game, you are sent into a deeper recess of your mind, and when you succeed in
a portion you can either be sent directly back into the exact moment you had been in, or you can also be sent into
different parts depending on what you do. Therefore, you are able to explore by killing yourself to venture deeper, and
by succeeding in order to progress. However, there is a maximum depth at which you will truly die, so the deeper
portions are more risky to spend time in as you can truly die.

## Saving
Not sure when you will get to save. Here is some ideas:
 - Save every time you win a section. This seems like a good compromise as you will still be able to save a reasonable
   amount.
 - Never. This will make exploration more of a playing the game many times thing.
 - when you come right back to the surface. This is pretty heavy I guess but you will just need to come up for air from
   time to time.
Ok actually, after writing these down I realise that you should not be able to save at all. The game is going to be easy
most of the time when you consider that you will be levels away from death. However, it also means that there will be
moments of true tension, and it will allow the player to enjoy the game for longer and probably play via different paths
due to coming back a few times and things happening differently.

## Gameplay of the game
The game should feature a whole bunch of different disjointed play styles and mini games for different parts I think.
There needs to be a good few bullet hell battle portions to showcase the bullet hell mechanics that the game is made to
fulfil. As well as that a large part of the game will be kubusian kind of static sprite walking around avoiding random
shit inside the brain. Other than that there will be a bunch of mini game type things, and I dunno what they will be
yet but a breakout clone would be fun. The mini games will be useful for league of piss as well so I am happy to work
on a few of those and make sure they can be reskinned easily etc.

## Point of the game
I guess the point of the game is to suggest that a deep descent into unpleasant reaches of the mind can eventually
result in something positive if you are able to drag yourself back out alive. In order to fully show this I think that
the game will need to result in an end that is positive, and shows that the character has become better than just being
back to normal.

For them to have improved.
